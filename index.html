                <p class= "paragraph">Photographer, Husband, Father, Jazz Fan, Video Game Nerd, and Star Wars superfan. Proud Dad to two of the coolest little girls on the planet, I take pride showing them the ways of the dark side, teaching them about Mario, and finding hidden Mickeys at disneyland. Traveling is a passion I share with my family, we love to experience new things, eat new foods, and make memories being outside of our comfort zone.<br>

                </br>I am an aspiring full stack web developer looking forward to the taking on the challenge of learning a new skill. Finding a career that I am passionate about, being able to develop the tools that will make life easier, that can bring about great change to people across the globe is something I am looking forward to.
